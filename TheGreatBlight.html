I hope this letter finds you well. Our endeavors have progressed quickly, and we have need of your time and talents. We&#39;ll be waiting.

Yours truly,
T.H. Renoux

You gaze at the oven for a few satisfying moments before you notice that the floor is covered in a thick amber syrup that is rapidly climbing up your ankles. As you struggle, you notice that the syrup is slowly but surely solidifying into amber.

&lt;i&gt;You&#39;ve been here before.&lt;/i&gt; 

You sit bolt upright, your ears pricked. Something is coming. Something terrible is going to crawl out of the ink-black.  

&lt;i&gt;It always does.&lt;/i&gt;

Straining against the stifling silence, you&#39;re half-hoping that this time, it will be different. Maybe this time, the horror is the nothingness itself. 

&lt;i&gt;But maybe that will be worse.&lt;/i&gt;

You blink twice and wish the ominous voice in your head would pipe down so you could stay more completely attuned to your surroundings. 

God dammit. Now you&#39;re waiting for your head-voice to start up again instead of thinking about what&#39;s going on around you. No good. This always happens to you&amp;mdash;waking or sleeping.   

&lt;i&gt;You ridiculous failure.&lt;/i&gt;

But then...

&lt;em&gt;*tap...tap...tap...*&lt;/em&gt;

...you hear it. It&#39;s a light, non-threatening sound that somehow still fills you with dread, but never mind that now. As usual, knowing you&#39;re dreaming spurs you forwards towards the sound. What&#39;s the worst that could happen?

Your widening eyes take in the thing before your brain can piece together an explanation. It&#39;s a finger...an enormous finger, tapping slowly and patiently all by itself in the darkness. 

And then there&#39;s another behind you, and another off to one side. And then you feel something lightly brush your hair. You look up. There are a half-dozen more swaying gently above you as well. They multiply endlessly, in all shapes and sizes. They&#39;re closing in. You cast your eyes about hopelessly, looking for a way out, and you see two things at precicely the same time. 

To the right, there&#39;s a gap in the finger-forest, juuuuust big enough for you to sneak through. 

To the left, there&#39;s something glinting between two small fingers inching past one another beneath a huge finger that&#39;s stabbing downwards randomly, seemingly trying to squash them like bugs.

&lt;strong&gt;GROSS&lt;/strong&gt;
 
You bolt to your feet and look around and see nothing but a wenge tinted abyss. 

&lt;em&gt;drip&lt;/em&gt;

Another drop lands on your head and you finally look up. Floating avove you is a giagantic, disembodied nose. You stumble back as you see another drop form and your foot slips into the abyss and you start to fall...

You bolt awake -- perhaps it was just a dream. As you run your hand through your hair, you find a bit of goo behind your left ear.
